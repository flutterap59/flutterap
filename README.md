## About Flutterap

Flutterap is a product of years of work on the admin panel with different programming languages. One of the challenges we encountered was that libraries like React did not allow us to access the hardware in a single platform. As a result, we looked for a framework that would give us hardware access under one programming language and also be highly efficient. We found the Dart language and the Flutter framework and created Flutterap from it.

## FAQ

#### Is flutterap only for admin panel ?

Flutterap components are centered on the admin panel. But these components were initially used for mobile phones. So you can use them for any platform

#### in flutterap only ready-made components ?

The good thing about flutterap is not only its ready components, but by using the provided folder structure, you no longer need to think about building the admin panel. You only have to think about your idea. We pave the way.
